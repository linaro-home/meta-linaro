# The ganglia autoconf setup doesn't include libmetrics in its
# AC_OUTPUT list -- it reconfigures libmetrics using its own rules.
# Unfortunately this means an OE autoreconf will not regenerate
# ltmain.sh (and others) in libmetrics and as such the build will
# fail.  We explicitly force regeneration of that directory.
